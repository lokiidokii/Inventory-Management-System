# Inventory-Management-System

<h3>About</h3>

<p>The inventory management system contains primary tables that in-house and outsourced parts and products, each of which can be added, modified, and deleted. Thereâ€™s an option that allows products to have associated parts that stay with the product and warns the user against removal. Both the parts and products can be searched for by the part or product ID (which is auto-generated by the program) and also complete or partial part or product name.</p>
