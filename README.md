# Inventory-Management-System

## Purpose
This inventory management system was built for a motorcycle parts company to store and keep track of parts and products inventory on local computers. 

## Description
The application is written in Java with use of the JavaFX library and SceneBuilder for ease of creating the GUI. It contains tables of in-house and outsourced parts and products, each of which can be added, modified, and removed. A built-in option allows products to have associated parts (parts that require other parts and/or must be bought with a specific product), notifying users of association before deletion of either part or product. The application also has simple search functionality, allowing users to search by Part or Product ID (auto-generated by the program) or complete/partial name of the part or product. 

## Environment Setup
**IDE:** Apache Netbeans 12.6<br>
**JDK:** Java SE 17.0.6<br>
**GUI:** JavaFX 17.0.1, Gluon Scene Builder 17
